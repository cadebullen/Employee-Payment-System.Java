# Employee-Payment-System.Java

This was a project completed during school, that uses interfaces and polymorphism in Java to create a payment system of a company.
It holds the information of different people that are being paid from: staff members, to hourly workers.
There is a driver class called "staff" that lists examples of each type of person to be paid.
